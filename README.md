- If you want to see backend source code, go to this [link](https://github.com/safagunay/LockerApi)

- There is BlockChain implementation(you can find in the folder "blockchain_implementation"):
    - Go to the our solidity code, go to this [link](https://github.com/mehmetozanguven/SecureSmartLockWithBlockChain-MobileApp/blob/master/blockchain_implementation/DeviceActivityLogger.sol)
    - Our BlockChain implementation runs in locally via Ganache
    - Backend implementation (in Azure) communicates with Ganache via python flask server, go to this [link](https://github.com/mehmetozanguven/SecureSmartLockWithBlockChain-MobileApp/blob/master/blockchain_implementation/ganacheclient.zip) for flask implementation
    
    
- There is also raspberry pi implementation (to unlock the door)
